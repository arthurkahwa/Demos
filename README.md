## AR Planets
#### You must run this on a real device, as it does not run on the simulator.
That is, either an iPad or an iPhone.

May have found Russell's Teapot floating around in space.
Also shows clearly, that the sun revolves around the earth.

Start the App and take a couple of steps back until all the Planets and the Teapot are visible.

* Transaction
* Smart Contract
